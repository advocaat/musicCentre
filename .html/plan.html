<h1>CP1406/CP2010 - 2015 - TCMC Project Plan</h1>
<h2>C4L</h2>
<p><strong>Members:</strong> Adam Nicholls, Jamieson Baker, Cameron Kent, Daan Felton-Busch</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>Our mission is to recruit new members and increase engagement of members in our activities, while also increasing ticket sales for our concerts, especially to members of the public and encourage performers to let us organise a concert for them and to cooperate with promotion, photo shoots and media releases. 
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of our mission will be evaluated through our website using the sign-up forms on the site. As more people sign up to become members, we will know whether or not we are recruiting new members and our members are engaging in our activities. People also have the opportunity to have concerts organised for their bands using our website and we also have a section on the website where visitors are able to view upcoming events and purchase tickets for concerts. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>We specialise in diversity and so we provide performance opportunities for a very wide range of styles and genres which would otherwise have little exposure, therefore we target audiences that include a wide range of ages and tastes. The typical audience may include people with specialised tastes such as Classical, Jazz or Ethnic music. If children are involved, then parents and family members predominate and every concert, therefore, needs a distinctive theme.
