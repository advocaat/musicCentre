        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to drive new signups by engaging users who
            don't already play volleyball, particularly those in the younger demographic,
            The website will encourage users to think about volleyball differently and to
            get involved in a way that may be less intemdating than competative sport.</p>
        
        <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
            <p>We will measure the success of the website by the tracking the number of
            new signups from our target audience.  We will add a mandatory "age bracket"
            field to the online signup form to ensure we are collecting the necessary data
            to evaluate our success.</p>
        
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>Our target audience is young people (high-school to young adults) who are not
            already involved in volleyball as a sport. As many young people now browse the
            internet on mobile devices, the website will be designed to be responsive and deliver
            our content effectively, regardless of screen size. We will use engaging language
            and iconography to capture the interest of the younger generation.</p>
